MITSUBA Renderer Configuration Project

Digital Imaging student we use mitsuba-renderer in order to learn the different ways to make global illumination in a 3D scene.

Our group study Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In order to make a very detailed study, I make some scripts in order to do automated tasks.

There is some bash scripts in order to make screenshots and check memory and cpu use. But there is also some c++ file, which process images coming from mitsuba
